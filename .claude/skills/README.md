# Skills

Reusable AI skills that provide specialized knowledge and workflows. Canonical location is `.claude/skills/` with a symlink at `.cursor/skills/ → ../.claude/skills` for Cursor compatibility. Shared with the team via version control.

## Catalog

| Skill | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| [run-plan](run-plan/SKILL.md) | Project | `/run-plan` — executes an approved Implementation Plan through the agent pipeline: implementer, a parallel architecture-reviewer + plan-verifier gate, a capped remediation loop, tests, final verification, merge gate, docs |
| [pr-self-review](pr-self-review/SKILL.md) | QA | Pre-merge review gate: classifies changed files, runs the applicable QA/architecture/tech skills, normalizes findings to Critical/High/Medium/Low, blocks merge on any confirmed Critical |
| [engineering-insights](engineering-insights/SKILL.md) | Project | Capture non-obvious decisions, gotchas, and fixes into the right package's `INSIGHTS.md`, as-you-go and at wrap-up |
| [workflow-retro](workflow-retro/SKILL.md) | Project | `/workflow-retro` — post-run retrospective on a multi-agent session: token spend, agent roster and launch order, duplicated work, and proposals; appends durable insights to `docs/retro/ledger.md` |
| [fastify-best-practices](fastify-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Backend | Fastify routes, plugins, JSON-schema validation, error handling |
| [drizzle-orm-patterns](drizzle-orm-patterns/SKILL.md) | Backend | Drizzle schema, queries, relations, transactions, migrations |
| [postgresql-table-design](postgresql-table-design/SKILL.md) | Backend | Postgres schema design, data types, indexing, constraints |
| [onion-architecture](onion-architecture/SKILL.md) | Backend | Layer boundaries & dependency direction across server/ modules and reviewer-core |
| [next-best-practices](next-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Frontend | Next.js App Router, RSC boundaries, data fetching, optimization |
| [react-best-practices](react-best-practices/SKILL.md) | Frontend | React anti-patterns, state management, hooks rules |
| [frontend-architecture](frontend-architecture/SKILL.md) | Frontend | React/Next.js folder structure, code organization, module boundaries |
| [react-testing-library](react-testing-library/SKILL.md) | Frontend | General-purpose React Testing Library guide with Vitest |
| [zod](zod/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | Zod schema validation, parsing, error handling, type inference |
| [typescript-expert](typescript-expert/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | Type-level programming, performance, tooling, migrations |
| [security](security/SKILL.md) | Full-stack | OWASP Top 10:2025, auth, injection, uploads, secrets |
| [mermaid-diagram](mermaid-diagram/SKILL.md) | Shared | Mermaid diagrams in markdown (flowcharts, sequence, ERD, …) |
| [dependency-checker](dependency-checker/SKILL.md) | Shared | Cross-package dependency graph, sizes, version drift, prioritized report |

## What Are Skills?

Skills are modular packages that extend the AI agent with specialized knowledge and workflows. Unlike rules (always applied) or agents (invoked for specific tasks), skills are loaded on-demand when the agent determines they're relevant.

### Skills vs Rules vs Commands vs Agents

| Type | Scope | Loaded | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Rules** (`.mdc`) | Project conventions | Always or by file pattern | Persistent guardrails |
| **Commands** (`.md`) | User actions | On `/command` invocation | Slash commands |
| **Skills** (`.md`) | Domain knowledge | On-demand by agent | Specialized knowledge |
| **Agents** (`.md`) | Workflows | Via Task tool | Subagent orchestration |

## Creating New Skills

Each skill has:

- `SKILL.md` — Main skill file with rules and conventions (required)
- `examples.md` — Code examples showing good/bad patterns (recommended)
- `references.md` — Sources and rationale (optional)
